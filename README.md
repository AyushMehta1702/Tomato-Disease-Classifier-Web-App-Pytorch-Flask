# Tomato Disease Classifier Web App Pytorch Flask Azure
 
Welcome to my project! This is a web-based application that uses machine learning to identify diseases in tomato plants from images of their leaves. The application will be hosted on Azure ASAP.

"A Flask-based web app leveraging a PyTorch CNN for real-time identification and information provision about diseases in tomato plants, trained on the PlantVillage Dataset."

## Dataset

The model was trained on the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). 

The tomato plant diseases included in the dataset are:

- Tomato Bacterial spot
- Tomato Early blight
- Tomato Late blight
- Tomato Leaf Mold
- Tomato Septoria leaf spot
- Tomato Spider mites Two-spotted spider mite
- Tomato Target Spot
- Tomato Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
- Tomato Tomato mosaic virus
- Tomato healthy
  
## Tools Used

- PyTorch for building and training the CNN
- Flask for building the web app
- HTML and CSS for the frontend
- Azure App Service for hosting the web application

## Azure Deployment

This web application will be deployed on Azure using Azure App Service. (ASAP)

## Setup and Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AyushMehta1702/Tomato-Disease-Classifier-Web-App-Pytorch-Flask.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd Tomato-Disease-Classifier-Web-App-Pytorch-Flask
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
